1. For reading large files,
   - first read file size, if small read all
   - if not, find number of seqs and inform user,
        - can be done with "indexing" files to a dict.
        - ask how many seq to read or he select which ones using a listbox etc.
        - if it selects too large number it may not fit to RAM
            - check RAM as you read some large bulks, exit reading if necessary

2. For printing large seqs
   - print into canvas only the shown area not all seqs.
   - scroll slowly and restart the scrollbar as it scrolls to end position
   - if he wants to view an arbitray index take x,y positon and print that region
